# This is the model storage 
1. Bert
    - Word2Vec generates fixed embeddings so it fails where words have drastic change of meanings when used in different sentences. 
    - It generates contextualized embeddings. It generates a meaningful number representation of a word. 




2. Quantization 
3. ONNX Deployment 

    - ONNX bridges the gap between the devlopment of a machine learning model to productonizating it. 

    - So the models trained on pytorch, tensorflow, mxnet or anything can be converted to onnx and used in python, c++, c#, or edge devices etc. 

    - We can direclty export in ONNX format or use some 3rd party libraries.
